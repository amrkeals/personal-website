				<h1>I Live in Your Eyes ..</h1>

		       Today, I present a love poem by the great Egyptian poet; Farouk Goweedah . He  is a contemporary poet who has written a lot of poetry in different topics. Goweedah is famous all over the Arab World. His words are very delicate and his style is so simple and passionate. The poem is in Fus’ha and is called, which literally means “In your eyes is my address“. However, I translated the title as “I Live in Your Eyes ..” The poem is a conversation between the woman beloved and her man. The woman fears that her man will forget her and he promises her an eternal love.
